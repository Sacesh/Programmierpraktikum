perl orf_finder <name of sequence file>
creates a folder "Results", which contains:

-> two histograms, one showing the cumulated absolute frequency of ORFs with a length between [1;200], where you can easily compare how many reading frames there are e.g. between [75;100]. A second histogram shows the frequency of all ORFs found.

-> a file lengthDistribution_<> which shows the data supplied for the histograms.

-> two files ORFpositionsForwardStrand_<> and ORFpositionsComplementaryStrand_<> which show the start and stop positions of the respective ORFs, and their length.

-> ORFsequencesForward_<> and ORFsequencesReverse_<> contain all the ORFs of the respective strands

-> Statistics_<> contains the statistics that are also printed to STDOUT.

(ORFs have been found on the input sequence in 5'-3' direction and on its reverse, complementary strand in 5'-3' direction.)
